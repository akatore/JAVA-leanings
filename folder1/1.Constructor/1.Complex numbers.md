# Constructor -> Complex numbers
https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/2986 \
Write a class named `Complex`. It must have two double fields `real` and `imaginary` and a constructor to initialize the fields. The order of parameters in the constructor must be the same as presented above.

```
Hint:
alt + ins = magic

create a class
declare a parameterised constructor.
thats it. :)

```
```java


class Complex {

    double real;
    double imaginary;

    public Complex(double real, double imaginary) {
        this.real = real;
        this.imaginary = imaginary;
    }
}

```
